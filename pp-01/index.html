  <h1>Embrace the Other Strategy</h1>
  <p>
    The two typefaces that I paired together were Merriweather and Rubik.
    When using the "Embrace the Other Strategy", it was recommended that successful
    pairs in this category use a sans-serif and serif font. Looking at the examples
    on TypeConnection, for the most part, serif fonts are used for the headers while
    the sans-serif fonts are used in the body to help provide some contrast.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Merriweather?</h2>
  <p>
    I choose Merriweather first, which is the serif font. It's style is very similar to that
    of Times New Roman. The differences of those two fonts are more noticeable side-by-side.
    Merriweather's serifs are more rounded and does have a bit more weight to it.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Rubik?</h2>
  <p>
    In my opinion, I feel that the serif font (Merriweather) is used for headers,
    while the sans-serif font (Rubik) is used for the paragraph text. In fact, it's
    being used right now. Looking at Merriweather's "About" section, they even
    recommended Merriweather Sans to complement and harmonize with its sans-serif
    counterpart, but I thought that would be too boring. So, I at least tried to find a
    somewhat similar font to Merriweather Sans. I believe these two fonts I choose
    would be a good pair for each other and both fonts have similar line weights
    to them as well
