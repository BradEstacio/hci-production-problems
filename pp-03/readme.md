## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/sidebars/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Referring to the sketches labeled redesign-naivigation.jpg and redesign-sidebar.jpg I decided to use a combination of the guidelines from the sidebar and navigation bar, but moreso the sidebar. I wanted to keep the menu as a sidebar but as to not take away from the space for the form so I moved the menu bar above with an indication that it can be tapped or possibly swiped to to access it. In the menu itself, I made sure that I gave the names in the side navigation the right amount of room so they wouldn't be bunched up together. I also made sure to point out in the sketch that you can re-hide the sidebar by tapping or swiping away as on the current website, you have to hit the "Close Menu" button to hide it. As stated earlier, hiding the sidebar will give more room for the form itself, but users will still know it would be accessible to them when they first get on the page.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/text-fields/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Referring to redesign-text-field.jpg, I made sure to have a clear button show up in the input field when highlighted by the user. With the password fields, the website hides the data entered, so that is carried over in the redesign. In redesign-data-entry.jpg, I got rid of the "Address 2" label and instead moved it closer to the "Address". To compensatae, I put a hint in the text field to communicate to the user what they can put in that field along with the fact that it's optional. 

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
