## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=14C0u0k9f2L3YeN3d61fQ2Cm32w
Your Rationale: When making this, I knew I wanted to use purple and black as purple is associated with creativity and black is associated with mystery. With these colors, they could express how innovative this hypothetical console is while adding some element of mystery it holds and what features seperates is from the other consoles. From there, I made it so that the palette contains shades of a very dark purple. That way, it almost comes off as being black without being a full shade of black, but you can still notice the purples if you look closely.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens
